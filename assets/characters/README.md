Characters folder

Place the character spritesheet (16x16) here. Recommended pack:
- Tiny 16 basic character sprites: https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-16-basic-character-sprites

Expected filename:
- tiny16_chars.png

The PreloadScene expects a spritesheet with frames 16x16. Animations created by default assume typical layout (walk frames 0-3, attack 8-11, death 12-15). Adjust indexes in PreloadScene.js if your sheet differs.
