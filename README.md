# Echo of Light

Mini pixel rogue-like (16x16 tiles) built with Phaser 3. Playable as a static site — ideal for GitHub Pages.

How to run locally:

1. From the project folder run a simple static server (example uses http-server):

```powershell
npx http-server -c-1 . -p 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/echo-of-light/
```

This project is intentionally minimal and uses generated tiles/sprites so it runs without external art.
